# Database Star - SQL Code Repository
This repository contains all of the SQL scripts used on the Database Star website (https://www.databasestar.com/) and the YouTube channel.
It's small at the moment but will expand over time.

It currently contains:
* All of the SQL scripts for many of my Database Star Academy courses (each of the course_ folders)
* Several sample datasets (within the sample_databases folder). The details of these, including descriptions and steps and ERDs, are described here: https://www.databasestar.com/sample-data-sql/
* Some SQL scripts used in some of my blog posts (within the posts folder)

If you find any issues with the scripts, feel free to create an Issue in this repository, or create a Pull Request.
The Sample Database scripts are being tested so may contain some issues.
